### What I learned

Oh! man, this one took me ages to complete this this much. i thought it was just an simple project with data json file, but it has a theme changing option which i thought will not be a problem but it took some time, but that was not the most problematic, filtering data based on a slider bar is new thing for me, i can't make the logic how to do that, and have to take help from ai. 

this choice make ai change my code in much smoother way that i don't even recognize it, this made it even longer to make changes, i was trying so hard not to take help from it, it is equavelent to watching a youtube tutorial for a singel problem after writing all code by yourself, making sense with his functions and classes is a mess.

after 3 days i decided to submit this project as it is for now and to complete it later, when i got better understanding on js, i need to let it go.

### Continued development

For now i need to start with frontend but i'm going to continue backend devoloping and then if everything goes correctly then will countinue either in robotics coding and developement or in gaming industry.
